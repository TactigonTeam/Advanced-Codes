# Range_Extender

This project has the goal to extend the range of communication of the Tactigon Skin (also T-Skin) to use it over longer distances that the ones that Bluetooth Low Energy can offer.

To achieve this goal, we used the UDP protocol over Wi-Fi to send data from the Tactigon Skin to a PC, using a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
Wi-Fi capabilities for the Tactigon Skin have been added by using a NodeMCU with a BLE module.
